Choose a password, a REALLY good password

This was an exercise to create a password according to certain conditions. 
While you enter your password, the fulfilled conditions appear with a green tick, the missing ones with a red cross. 
With a click on the button you can display your password.

The application was created with Vue CDN, Html5 and CSS 3.
